Help to find Peter's exact age
Write a method that take Peter's birthday in form of DateTime and return Peter's age in form of String.

The string should be in the following form:

string.Format("Peter is {0} years, {1} months and {2} days old", Years, Months, Days);
for Example suppose you are solving this kata in November 15th, 2015, and Peter's birthday is September 21st, 1983 so the result should be:

"Peter is 32 years, 1 months and 24 days old"
and again suppose you are solving this kata in November 15th, 2015, and Peter's birthday is October 14th, 2014 so the result should be:

"Peter is 1 years, 1 months and 1 days old"
